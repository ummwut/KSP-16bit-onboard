Virtual machine specs (version 2)

Classes you need: machine.cs, loader.cs, hdwr.cs, counter.cs

Group them up, compile and run. Make modifications how you please, but I'm not responsible for any wierdness that 
happens when you do. You might want to add a keyboard and monitor class, inheriting from hdwr.cs before you do 
anything else, since those are not included.

Sorry for the poor formatting.

A quick summary of the virtual machine:

• all registers are 16 bits wide
• memory is an array of 65,536 16bit words (This is because I'm lazy, and this allows for 128k of 
	memory instead of half that.)
• the virtual machine clock speed is constrained only by the speed of the host machine
• 10 general registers (R0 through R9)
• an Index Base "IB" register (added to the value of a register used as an index)
• a Program Counter "PC" register
• a FLags register "FL"
• a Stack Pointer register "SP"
• a pseudo-register Stack register "ST" (referring to this is like using PUSH/POP)
• a pseudo-register Next Word register "NW" (refers to an immediate value; the next word)
• 32 Special Registers (Only one is seeing consistent use for now: SPECREG 0 is the Interrupt Handler Address, "IHA")

Execution is achieved by reading in the word at wherever PC is pointing, then incrementing PC after the word is read. The 
instruction then does whatever it's supposed to do. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

There are interrupts and an interrupt queue. Both must be enabled by setting their flags. The interrupt flag need not be set 
to queue interrupts, but it must be set to allow interrupts to be addressed. If the interrupt queue flag is reset while there
are messages on the queue, they will be lost. If interrupts are enabled but the queue is not, interrupts will never be 
addressed, due to no interrupts ever being placed on the queue. If the queue is full, no additional interrupts will be added.


The endian-ness of this virtual machine depends on the host machine's endian-ness, as a consequence of being compiled 
on that machine. However, it shouldn't matter, as everything is handled in 16 bit chunks anyway. Therefore, endian-ness
is only in consideration of multi-word operations, which will be up to the running code.

About instructions and registers:

Instructions are one word long, unless using the Next Word. All instructions take one clock cycle. In every instruction, the 
upper 6 bits are the opcode, the remaining 10 bits are register codes. The registercodes are 5 bits each: the uppermost bit 
is an index flag, the lower 4 bits are the register specifier. Consequently, all registers may be used as index registers, in any 
operation whatsoever. For example, the code "000000 11101 11111" would copy the value of the memory indexed by 
SP to the memory address indexed by the Next Word. Writing directly to Next Word fails without throwing an error, only 
resulting in data loss.

Register summary:
Name	Value	Desription

R0 to R9	0x0 - 0x9	General registers
IB	0xA	Index Base. This register's value is always added to the value of every register used as an index.
PC	0xB	Program Counter. This register holds the memory address of the next instruction. It is always 
		incremented after an instruction is read, and is incremented when the Next Word is read.
FL	0xC	The Flag register. This register's bits flag the status of the machine. Unused flags should always be 
		considered as set at Zero. From highest to lowest order bit, the flag bits stand for: operation resulted 
		in a Carry, operation resulted in a Zero, Operation Divided by zero, First value was greater than 
		second value in an unsigned comparison, First value was greater than second value in a signed 
		comparison, First value was equal to second value, First value was less than second value in a signed 
		comparison, First value was less than second value in an unsigned comparison, Interrupt queue 
		enabled, Interrupts enabled, Unused, Unused, Unused, Unused, Unused, Unused.
SP	0xD	The Stack Pointer register. This register's value points to the location of the top of the stack. *SP 
		should be used to PEEK the stack.
ST	0xE	The Stack. This pseudo-register is used as a normal register, to facilitate interactions with the stack. 
		Writing to ST means to PUSH the value, while reading from ST means to POP. 
NW	0xF	The Next Word. This pseudo-register is used as an immediate value, and although it can be written 
		to, nothing will happen when this is done. *NW is used as writing/reading from a fixed location in 
		memory.
IHA	0x0	The Interrupt Handler Address. This special register holds the address copied to PC when an interrupt is pulled 
		off the queue. What happens after the address is loaded is up to the instructions at the address.

Opcode summary:
Name	Value	Description

SET	0x00	Set. Copies the value of the first register to the second register.
EXCH	0x01	Register Exchange. Exhanges the values between the first and second registers.
TWOC	0x02	Two's Compliment. Two's Compliments the value of the first register, and saves it to the second register.
ADD	0x03	Add. Adds the values of the first and second register, and saves the result to the second register.
		Compares thev against each other before the operation. Modifies Carry and Zero.
ADDC	0x04	Add with Carry. Adds the values of Carry, the first and second register, and saves the result to the second register.
		Compares the registers against each other before the operation. Modifies Carry and Zero.
SUB	0x05	Subtract. Subtracts second register from first register, and saves the result to the second register.
		Compares the registers against each other before the operation. Modifies Carry and Zero.
SUBC	0x06	Subtract with Carry. Subtracts Carry and the second register from the first register, and saves it to the second register.
		Compares the registers against each other before the operation. Modifies Carry and Zero.
MUL	0x07	Unsigned Multiply. Multiplies the first register and the second register, without regard to sign. The low word of the 
		operation is saved in the first register, while the high word of the operation is saved in the second
		register. Carry is set if the high word is not zero, while Zero is set if the low word is zero.
DIV	0x08	Unsigned Divide. Divides the first register by the second register. If the second register is zero, the operation is not 
		completed, and the Divide By Zero flag is set. Otherwise, the integer part of the result is saved
		in the first register, and the fraction part is saved in the second register. If the integer part is zero, 
		the Zero flag is set. If the fraction part is not zero, the Carry flag is set.
XOR	0x09	Bitwise Exclusive Or. Exclusive Ors the registers together, and saves the result in the second register.
		Compares the registers against each other before the operation. Modifies Zero.
AND	0x0A	Bitwise And. Ands the registers together, and saves the result in the second register.
		Compares the registers against each other before the operation. Modifies Zero.
OR	0x0B	Bitwise Or. Ors the registers together, and saves the result in the second register.
		Compares the registers against each other before the operation. Modifies Zero.

STI	0x0E	Stream Increment. Copies the memory indexed by the first register to the memory indexed by the second register, 
		then increments both.
STD	0x0F	Stream Decrement. Copies the memory indexed by the first register to the memory indexed by the second register, 
		then decrements both.
ROL	0x10	Rotate Bits Left. Rotates the bits in the first register left, and saves the result to the second register.
ROR	0x11	Rotate Bits Right. Rotates the bits in the first register right, and saves the result to the second register.
ROLC	0x12	Rotate Bits Left through Carry. Rotates the bits in the first register left, with the highest bit rotating into carry, while Carry
		is rotated into the lowest bit. The result is saved in the second register.
RORC	0x13	Rotate Bits Right through Carry. Rotates the bits in the first register right, with the lowest bit rotating into carry, while 
		Carry is rotated into the highest bit. The result is saved in the second register.
SHL	0x14	Shift Bits Left. Shifts the bits in the first register left. The highest bit is shifted into Carry, while a zero is shifted into the 
		lowest bit. 
SHR	0x15	Shift Bits Right. Shifts the bits in the first register right. The lowest bit is shifted into Carry, while a zero is shifted into the 
		highest bit. 
SHRA	0x16	Shift Bits Right Arithmetically. Shifts the bits in the first register right. The lowest bit is shifted into Carry, while the highest 
		bit is shifted right and copied to its previous bit position.
IFSET	0x17	Conditional Set to PC. Bitwise Ands the first register with FL, and copies the second register to PC if the result is not zero.
		No flags are modified.
IFADD	0x18	Conditional Add to PC. Bitwise Ands the first register with FL, and adds the second register to PC if the result is not zero.
		No flags are modified.
CALL	0x19	Call Subroutine. PC is pushed to the stack, the first register is copied to PC and the second register. The second register 
		is typically IB when calling to subroutines that assume the start of code is at Address 0000.
INT	0x1A	Add Code to Interrupt Queue. The first register is added to the Interrupt Queue and is also copied to the second register.
IRET	0x1B	Return from Interrupt. The Interrupt Enabled flag is set, and the first register is copied to the second register. The registers
		are typically set as ST and PC, respectivally.
GSPEC	0x1C	Get Special Register. Copies the value from a special register (designated by the literal value of the first register value in the 
		instruction) to the second register.
SSPEC	0x1D	Set Special Register. Copies the first register to a special register (designated by the literal value of the second register value 
		in the instruction).
HDWR	0x1E	Hardware Signal. Signals the hardware designated by the first register with a code held by the second register.
		This aspect of the virtual machine has not been developed at all.

About Hardware:

There is practically nothing I have done to work on this, besides a basic counter that signals an interrupt when it reaches zero. Refer to the
Counter's class file to see how a hardware object should be layed out. Adding hardware involves changing the source of the machine class,
and this is terribly sloppy but I have not had time to figure out a good hardware interface as of now. Maybe someone will have a good 
suggestion.
