Okay. So basically, I had a virtual machine (on paper) laying around for quite a long while.

At some point, I discovered the game Kerbal Space Program and instantly loved it! The free version was neato, so I decided to cough up the money for the new releases beyond 13.3, and discovered that there was a plugin system to add features to the game. This kicked off the idea to add my virtual machine to the game via plugin, since I had desired a flight computer for a flight-control computer, but MechJeb was monstorous and could not be reprogrammed without actually re-writing the C# files and recompiling. 

No one wants to mess around with any of that, especially not me. So I decided to code up my virtual machine and interface it with KSP. Coding and completing the system's processor ws the easy part. Tossing together some code for a really sloppy assembler was necessary for quick testing. Now, I'm stuck on ideas for hardware for it, since I know nothing about KSP's GUI (which I intend to use to emulate a minimizable screen for the VM) and catching keys would prove to be potentially difficult, given the need to differentiate between rocket control keystrokes and keystrokes intended for the VM. 

So here we are. Basically a virtual computer box without a keyboard, screen, or even ports to "plug" any of that stuff in. Suggestions, anyone?
